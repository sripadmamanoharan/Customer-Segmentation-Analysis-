# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-


This project demonstrates customer segmentation using clustering algorithms like K-Means and DBSCAN on a retail dataset. The objective is to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

Key Objectives:
Perform data exploration on customer purchasing data.
Apply clustering algorithms such as K-Means and DBSCAN.
Visualize clusters and provide insights for business decision-making.
Skills Demonstrated
Data Science
Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
K-Means, DBSCAN
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Tools & Technologies
Python: Data manipulation and modeling using Pandas and Scikit-learn.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating plots.
SQL: For handling data (optional, not used in the Python implementation).
Power BI/Tableau: For advanced visualization (optional).
Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, create derived features like TotalAmount, and scale data.
K-Means Clustering: Apply K-Means clustering and use the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters.
DBSCAN Clustering: Apply DBSCAN to detect noise and identify clusters based on density.
PCA for Visualization: Reduce dimensions using PCA and visualize the clusters.
Insights and Recommendations: Provide insights based on customer segmentation and suggest marketing strategies.
